# PyTorch-Disentangling-Content-and-Style-Unsupervised

My PyTorch Disentangling Content and Style via Unsupervised Geometry Distillation the ICLR 2019 workshop paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04538). At the time I implemented there was no original code or their datasets available, and I could not quite get the same results they showcased but I do like their model and method. I haven't revisted this since implementing it back when the paper came out, so I'm not sure if their data or source code is available to improve my results to align with theirs.
